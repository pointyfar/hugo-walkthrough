Welcome!

While there really is no substitute to reading the documentation thoroughly (several times), 
this tutorial series aims to walk you through the basics of how to make a website 
([this very website, in fact](https://phw.netlify.com/)) with Hugo. No fancy 
JavaScript, not a lot of CSS, just enough HTML to make things work. This is 
intended to complement the excellent [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/)
(which you really should go read) which will frequently be referenced throughout
the tutorial.

### Why write yet another Hugo tutorial?

Yes, there are plenty of other guides and tutorials out there, better written 
and by people smarter than myself. I have personally found though that most of 
them are either too basic, simple `Hello World` examples, which don't go to 
enough depth, or too complicated for a first-time Hugo adventurer.
