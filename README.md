# A Hugo Walkthrough

Yes, another one.

While there really is no substitute to reading the documentation thoroughly (several times), this tutorial series aims to walk you through the basics of how to make a website ([this very website, in fact](https://phw.netlify.com/)) with Hugo. No fancy JavaScript, not a lot of CSS, just enough HTML to make things work. This is intended to complement the excellent [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/) (which you really should go read) which will frequently be referenced throughout the tutorial.

## Why write yet another Hugo tutorial?

Yes, there are plenty of other guides and tutorials out there, better written and by people smarter than myself. I have personally found though that most of them are either too basic, simple `Hello World` examples, which don't go to enough depth, or too complicated for a first-time Hugo adventurer.

## What this walkthrough DOES NOT cover

* How to write HTML/CSS/JS code
* How to `git`
* How to deploy your site
* How to configure a different theme
* Why your Hugo site isn't working

## Disclaimer

I am by no means an expert on Hugo and I do not intend to suggest that the way I do things is the only way that is correct. Code writing is as much science as art, and there are usually multiple ways of achieving the same thing.
