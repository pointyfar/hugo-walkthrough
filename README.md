# A Hugo Walkthrough

Yes, another one.

This tutorial series aims to walk you through the basics of how to make a website with Hugo. No fancy JavaScript, not a lot of CSS, just enough HTML to make things work. This is intended to complement the excellent [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/) (which you really should go read) which will frequently be referenced throughout the tutorial.

## Why write yet another Hugo tutorial?

Yes, there are plenty of other guides and tutorials out there, better written and by people smarter than myself. I have personally found though that most of them are either too basic, simple `Hello World` examples, which don't go to enough depth, or too complicated for a first-time Hugo adventurer.

## What this walkthrough DOES NOT cover

* How to write HTML/CSS/JS code
* How to `git`
* How to deploy your site
* How to configure a different theme
* Why your Hugo site isn't working
