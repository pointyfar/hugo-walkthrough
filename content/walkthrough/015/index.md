Congratulations on making it this far!

The posts thus far should be enough to help you get a basic website made with Hugo. Of course there's plenty more to learn about Hugo, and indeed there are more posts that will be written. 

A recap what we've done since the [last check-in](./../011/):

1. [Some prettifying](/012/)
1. [Added images to content](/013/)
1. [Used page bundles and resources](/014/)

This tutorial series at this point is by no means comprehensive, but it is not meant to be. My hope is that it helps demystify Hugo, and that this gives you an appetite for more of its awesomeness. 

If you have a copy of the code, `layouts_02` captures the state of the layouts at this point.
