Congratulations on making it this far!

The posts thus far should be enough to help you get a basic website (running locally) made with Hugo. Of course there's plenty more to learn about Hugo, and indeed there are more posts that will be written. 

A recap of what we've done since the [last check-in](./../011/):

1. [Some prettifying](./../012/)
1. [Added images to content](./../013/)
1. [Used page bundles and resources](./../014/)
1. [Defined a 404 page](./../015/)

This tutorial series at this point is by no means comprehensive, but it is not meant to be. My hope is that it helps demystify Hugo, and that this gives you an appetite for more of its awesomeness. 

If you have a copy of the code, `layouts_02` captures the state of the layouts at this point.

Notes:

The following sections cover topics that may apply only to certain types of websites but not all websites will use all of these futures. You may wish to skip sections not applicable to you, or go through these in a different order if you wish.

Onwards and upwards!
